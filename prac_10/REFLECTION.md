# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Not always accurate. Sometimes I underestimated the time needed, especially when debugging took longer than expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I became better at judging time for simple tasks, and learned to allow extra time for testing and unexpected bugs.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to plan more realistically and consider both coding and testing time in my estimates.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned different ways to approach the same problem and got helpful feedback on naming and code structure.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

It helped me spot common mistakes more easily and made me more critical of my own code as well.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review on Prac 6 – candicechristyy/CP1404](https://github.com/candicechristyy/CP1404/pull/2)

### Explanation

I reviewed the logic, made sure all files were correct and complete, and suggested improvements clearly. I also ensured consistency in coding style.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review on Prac 7 – ChaoYuyang1919810/prac7](https://github.com/ChaoYuyang1919810/prac7/pull/1)

### Explanation

Although I did review this, the code or files were incomplete or not fully ready. I left comments but it wasn’t a full code review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Maybe reduce the number of small tasks and combine them into fewer but slightly bigger challenges, so we can focus more deeply on each one.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I followed good coding structure, kept my code clean, and committed regularly with clear messages.
